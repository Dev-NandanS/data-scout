# Data Scout

Data Scout is a Natural Language to SQL chatbot designed to convert user queries into SQL, execute them on a database, and return relevant search results. It can be easily integrated into any website and offers a conversational interface for users to interact with databases using plain language.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands user queries in plain language.
- **SQL Query Generation**: Converts natural language queries into accurate SQL commands.
- **Database Integration**: Executes SQL queries on a connected database.
- **Conversational Interface**: Chatbot-style interaction that can be embedded into websites.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable to various types of databases and website platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or higher)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for backend development
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) or another NLP library
- A SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   
   git clone https://github.com/y](https://github.com/muhammed-ziyan-ummalil/data-scout
   cd data-scout
   

2. Install the necessary dependencies:


   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your database and update the connection details in the configuration file.

### Usage

1. Start the Flask server:


   python app.py


2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Interact with the chatbot by entering natural language queries (e.g., "Find a phone with a 5000mAh battery and red color").

### Example Queries

- "Show me laptops with 16GB RAM."
- "I need a phone with a 64MP camera."
- "Find me a blue shirt in size medium."

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main backend logic for handling chatbot interactions and SQL execution.
- `templates/` - Frontend HTML files for the chatbot interface.
- `static/` - CSS and JavaScript files for styling and chatbot interactions.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies required to run Data Scout.

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for complex queries**: Improve the NLP model to handle more sophisticated natural language queries.
- **Contextual understanding**: Enable the chatbot to maintain conversation context for follow-up questions.
- **Support for multiple databases**: Extend compatibility with different types of databases.
